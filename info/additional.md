**Optional goals**

**Rank 2**: Your function can work with 4 arguments.

-- Four arguments -- The lengths of each side on a cyclic quadrilateral (one that can be inscribed in a circle)

```python
0 < len(args) <= 4
```

**Rank 3**: Your function can work with 5 and 6 arguments.

-- Five arguments -- The lengths of each side on an equidiagonal quadrilateral 
(whose two diagonals have equal length) and the length of a diagonal.
 
-- The lengths of each side on a convex quadrilateral and the lengths of diagonals.

```python
0 < len(args) <= 6
```
