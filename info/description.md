You should write a function to calculate the area of simple figures: circles, rectangles and triangles.
You are give an arbitrary number of arguments which the function should use to calculate the area for the different figures.

- One argument -- The diameter of a circle and you need calculate the area of the circle.
- Two arguments -- The side lengths of a rectangle and you need calculate the area of the rectangle.
- Three arguments -- The lengths of each side on a triangle and you need calculate the area of the triangle.

The result should be given with two digit precision like so: +-0.01
